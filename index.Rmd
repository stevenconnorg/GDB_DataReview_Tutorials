# Toolbox Overview {#overview}
This document gives an overview of how to use the GDB_DataReview ArcMap Toolbox.

The GDB_DataReview ArcMap Toolbox provides numerous Python script tools to expedite the review of geodatabases in comparison with a template geodatabase model. This toolbox was developed to aid Air Force (AF) installations in maintaining geospatial data in compliance with the current Air Force Data Model (GeoBase 3.1.0.1) developed under the [AF GeoBase mission](https://www.sdsfieonline.org/Components/USAF). 

The GeoBase 3.1.0.1 data model is based upon the [Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure, and Environment (SDSFIE)](https://www.sdsfieonline.org/) SDSFIE-V 3.1 Gold model, which complies with  the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8130.01, *Installation Geospatial Information and Service* (IGI&S), but  allows some greater flexibility within the program to aid the AF mission. As part of the IGI&S program, this toolbox also aids in standardizing methods to adhere to the Fiscal Year 2017 CIP data call required by DoDI 8130.01.

The GDB_DataReview Toolbox provides methods to:

* Update feature class data using both [tabular](#joinCalc) and [spatial](#spatjoinCalc) joins,
* Find [duplicate geometries](#dupGeom), delete [duplicate features](#dupFeats), and [check/repair](#chkGeom) feature geometries,
* Standardize [road prefixes, names and suffixes](#std3) or [building addresses](#stdAdd1),
* [Search for](#indtSearch) and [summarize](#summIndt) indeterminant and missing data in a geodatabase when compared with a template geodatabase
* Batch [exporting](#exMeta) and [importing](#imMeta) geodatabase metadata

# Opening the Toolbox
In order to access this toolbox, open ArcCatalog (or the ArcCatalog window within ArcMap). Within the 'Catalog Tree' windowpane in ArcCatalog, click the Folder Connections folder and navigate to the location of the toolbox. You may need to add a folder connection by right clicking 'Folder Connections' and clicking 'Connect to Folder.' Then navigate to the folder with the toolbox within the newly connected folder. Then, you can click the plus sign by the toolbox to view the tools within it (Fig. \@ref(fig:opentoolbox)).

```{r opentoolbox, cache=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Opening the Create Site Data tool",fig.align='center'}
